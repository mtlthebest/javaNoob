  +----------------------------+
  | PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE I USE |
  +----------------------------+

- Java (with open-source JDK 7, see http://openjdk.java.net/).


  +-------------------------------------+
  | PROGRAMMING/DEVELOPMENT TOOLS I USE |
  +-------------------------------------+

- Operating System: Xubuntu 11.10 (Oneiric Ocelot) 64-bit PC
  (AMD64) desktop (image: xubuntu-11.10-desktop-amd64.iso);
- L.A.M.P. platform; // sudo apt-get install apache2
                     // mysql-server phpmyadmin
- Java: openjdk-7-jdk, Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build
  1.7.0_03-b04, command-line "java" and "javac");
- Eclipse Platform v3.7.0 ("INDIGO");
- gedit v3.2.3;
- nano v2.2.6;
- dia v0.97.1 (especially to draw and develop UML diagrams);
- JDBC, with MySQL connector/J v5.1.19;
- git (with my GitHub account);
- Microsoft Access 2003 on Windows 7 (for practicing with
  foreign keys and making comparisons with MySQL, I think it's
  a good sandbox anyway, especially for the InnoDB engine);
- MySQL Workbench v5.2.39 (for RBDMS design and MySQL schemas
  forward-engineering);
- yakuake (I love using bash pressing F12...);
- PAPER AND PENCIL!!! ;^)


  +------------------+
  | THE GENERAL IDEA |
  +------------------+

The main purpose of this repository (I look at it as a
programming sand-box) is to make a Java newbie (i.e.: myself)
learn JDBC, GUIs, Design Patterns, UML, git, etc... I'd like to
interact with other "newbies" in this IT field to explore
techniques and share know-how. I'm not trying to develop new
shiny inventions (for now) ;^) Instead, I'm focusing on good
programming for now. My personal aim is to become a GOOD Java /
MySQL / JDBC / UML / XHTML / Design Pattern user and programmer
(briefly, I'd like to build-up and stock some know-how). Don't
you think that's a lot for now? I hope some other newbie
programmer is aiming to do the same...


  +----------------------+
  | PROGRAMMING EXERCISE |
  +----------------------+
      (... for now...)

Write a program that interacts with a MySQL database, which is
hosted on a local machine. The program must have a G.U.I.
(graphic user interface) and allow some basic operations on the
database (fetch and modify data; i.e. a "C.R.U.D." application).
